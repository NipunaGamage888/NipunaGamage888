ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Nipuna Gamage, the last child of a South Asian family, navigating a journey from introversion to web development enthusiast. Growing up, my parents encouraged me to connect with neighbors and relatives, but I struggled to find common ground. Making friends seemed like an uphill battle. However, everything changed when I entered middle school and discovered my passion for IT.

ðŸŒŸ Studying IT opened doors to a world where I felt at home. I immersed myself in learning, gaining skills, and finding like-minded individuals who shared my interest. It wasn't just about coding; it was about building connections and friendships with people who understood the joy of technology.

ðŸ’¡ As a full stack developer, I've honed my skills in languages like React, Next.js, Node.js, and Express.js, alongside mastering CSS with Sass and Tailwind CSS. I've even ventured into the realm of 3D web development using Three.js.

ðŸš€ Beyond the screen, I cherish real-world adventures. Whether it's gaming, playing cricket with friends, or exploring new cultures and destinations, I'm always up for an adventure.

Let's connect and collaborate on some exciting projects together!
